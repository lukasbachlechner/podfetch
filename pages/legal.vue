      <p>
        We have written this privacy policy (version 01.01.1970-121657019) to
        provide you with information in accordance with the requirements of the

        as well as to explain what information we collect, how we use data and
        what choices you have as a visitor to this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy policies usually sound very technical. However, this version
        should describe the most important things as simply and clearly as
        possible. Moreover, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly
        manner whenever possible. We would also like to convey that we only
        collect and use information via this website if there is a corresponding
        legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible if you give very
        brief technical explanations, as are often standard on the Internet when
        it comes to data protection. We hope you find the following explanations
        interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information
        that you did not know yet.<br />
        Should you still have questions, we kindly ask you to follow the
        existing links to see further information on third-party websites, or to
        simply write us an email. You can find our contact information in our
        website’s imprint.

      <h2 id="automatische-datenspeicherung-en">Automatic Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is
        automatically created and saved, just as it happens on this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our
        webserver (computer on which this website is saved/stored) automatically
        saves data such as
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
        <li>browser and browser version</li>
        <li>the used operating system</li>
        <li>the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)</li>
        <li>
          the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed
          from
        </li>
        <li>date and time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>in files (webserver-logfiles).</p>
      <p>
        Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get
        deleted automatically. We do not pass this information to others, but we
        cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case
        of illegal conduct.
      </p>
      <h2 id="cookies-en">Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
        For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement,
        we will explain to you below what cookies are and why they are in use.
      </p>
      <h3>What exactly are cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are
        for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft
        Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files
        are called cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little
        helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these
        are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses.
        http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer.
        These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which
        is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a
        value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be
        specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or
        personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser
        submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to
        cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you
        are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in
        others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party
        cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are
        created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is
        individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration
        time of a cookie also varies – it can be a few minutes, or up to a few
        years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses,
        trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s
        information.
      </p>
      <p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>name:</strong> _ga<br />
        <strong>value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121657019-9<br />
        <strong>purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br />
        <strong>expiration date:</strong> after 2 years
      </p>
      <p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
        <li>at least 50 cookies per domain</li>
        <li>at least 3000 cookies in total</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
      <p>
        What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain
        this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly,
        we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.
      </p>
      <p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Essential Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies are necessary to
        ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for
        example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing
        on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the
        checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies
        ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purposive Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies collect info
        about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any
        error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading
        time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Target-orientated Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies care for
        an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously
        entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advertising Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies are also known
        as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually
        adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also
        rather annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these
        cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of
        course also be saved in a cookie.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I delete cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus,
        no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the
        option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore,
        you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other
        cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine
        which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in
        your browser-settings:

        If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up
        your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is
        about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to
        either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings
        for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for
        you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome,
        you could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or
        “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.
      </p>
      <h3>How is my data protected?</h3>
      <p>
        There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009. It states
        that the storage of cookies requires the user’s consent. However, among
        the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed
        reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96
        section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical
        documentation, we recommend

        Google Analytics Privacy Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        We use the tracking and analysis tool Google Analytics (GA) of the
        US-American company Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View,
        CA 94043, USA). Google Analytics collects data on your actions on our
        website. Whenever you click a link for example, this action is saved in
        a cookie and transferred to Google Analytics. With the help of reports
        which we receive from Google Analytics, we can adapt our website and our
        services better to your wishes. In the following, we will explain the
        tracking tool in more detail, and most of all, we will inform you what
        data is saved and how you can prevent this.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Google Analytics?</h3>
      <p>
        Google Analytics is a tracking tool with the purpose of conducting data
        traffic analysis of our website. For Google Analytics to work, there is
        a tracking code integrated to our website. Upon your visit to our
        website, this code records various actions you perform on your website.
        As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google
        Analytics server, where it is stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google processes this data and we then receive reports on your user
        behaviour. These reports can be one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Target audience reports: With the help of target audience reports we
          can get to know our users better and can therefore better understand
          who is interested in our service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertising reports: Through advertising reports we can analyse our
          online advertising better and hence improve it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide us helpful
          information on how we can get more people enthusiastic about our
          service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Behaviour reports: With these reports, we can find out how you
          interact with our website. By the means of behaviour reports, we can
          understand what path you go on our website and what links you click.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conversion reports: A conversion is the process of leading you to
          carry out a desired action due to a marketing message. An example of
          this would be transforming you from a mere website visitor into a
          buyer or a newsletter subscriber. Hence, with the help of these
          reports we can see in more detail, if our marketing measures are
          successful with you. Our aim is to increase our conversion rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Real time reports: With the help of these reports we can see in real
          time, what happens on our website. It makes us for example see, we can
          see how many users are reading this text right now.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3>
      <p>
        The objective of our website is clear: We want to offer you the best
        possible service. Google Analytics’ statistics and data help us with
        reaching this goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths
        and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimise our page
        in a way, that makes it easier to be found by interested people on
        Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to get a better
        understanding of you as our visitor. Therefore, we can very accurately
        find out what we must improve on our website, in order to offer you the
        best possible service. The analysis of that data also enables us to
        carry out our advertising and marketing measures in a more individual
        and more cost-effective way. After all, it only makes sense to show our
        products and services exclusively to people who are interested in them.
      </p>
      <h3>What data gets stored by Google Analytics?</h3>
      <p>
        With the aid of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random,
        unique ID which is connected to your browser cookie. That way, Google
        Analytics recognises you as a new user. The next time you visit our
        site, you will be recognised as a “recurring” user. All data that is
        collected gets saved together with this very user ID. Only this is how
        it is made possible for us to evaluate and analyse pseudonymous user
        profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your interactions on our website are measures by tags such as cookies
        and app instance IDs. Interactions are all kinds of actions that you
        perform on our website. If you are also using other Google systems (such
        as a Google Account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked
        with third-party cookies. Google does not pass on any Google Analytics

      </p>
      <p>
        Below we will give you an overview of the most important data that can
        be evaluated by Google Analytics:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates so-called Heatmaps an. These
        Heatmaps make it possible to see the exact areas you click on, so we can
        get information on what routes you make on our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Session duration:</strong> Google calls the time you spend on
        our website without leaving it session duration. Whenever you are
        inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bounce rate</strong> If you only look at one page of our website
        and then leave our website again, it is called a bounce.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Account creation:</strong> If you create an account or make an
        order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>IP-Address:</strong> The IP address is only shown in a shortened
        form, to make it impossible to clearly allocate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Your approximate location and the country you
        are in can be defined by the IP address. This process is called IP
        location determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical information:</strong> Information about your browser
        type, your internet provider and your screen resolution are called
        technical information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Source:</strong> Both, Google Analytics as well as ourselves,
        are interested what website or what advertisement led you to our site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further possibly stored data includes contact data, potential reviews,
        playing media (e.g. when you play a video on our site), sharing of
        contents via social media or adding our site to your favourites. This
        list is not exhaustive and only serves as general guidance on Google
        Analytics’ data retention.
      </p>
      <h3>How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
      <p>
        Google has servers across the globe. Most of them are in America and
        therefore your data is mainly saved on American servers. Here you can
        read detailed information on where Google’s data centres are located:
        <a
          href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Your data is allocated to various physical data mediums. This has the
        advantage of allowing to retrieve the data faster, and of protecting it
        better from manipulation. Every Google data centre has respective
        emergency programs for your data. Hence, in case of a hardware failure
        at Google or a server error due to natural disasters, the risk for a
        service interruption stays relatively low.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Analytics has a 26 months standardised period of retaining your
        user data. After this time, your user data is deleted. However, we have
        the possibility to choose the retention period of user data ourselves.
        There are the following five options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deletion after 14 months</li>
        <li>Deletion after 26 months</li>
        <li>Deletion after 38 months</li>
        <li>Deletion after 50 months</li>
        <li>No automatical deletion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As soon as the chosen period is expired, the data is deleted once a
        month. This retention period applies to any of your data which is linked
        to cookies, user identification and advertisement IDs (e.g. cookies of
        the DoubleClick domain). Any report results are based on aggregated
        information and are stored independently of any user data. Aggregated
        information is a merge of individual data into a single and bigger unit.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
      <p>
        Under the provisions of the European Union’s data protection law, you
        have the right to obtain information on your data and to update, delete
        or restrict it. With the help of a browser add on that can deactivate
        Google Analytics’ JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you can
        prevent Google Analytics from using your data. You can download this add
        on at
        <a
          href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB"

          rel="noopener"
          >https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a
        >. Please consider that this add on can only deactivate any data
        collection by Google Analytics.

        Google Analytics IP Anonymisation
      </h2>
      <p>
        We implemented Google Analytics’ IP address anonymisation to this
        website. Google developed this function, so this website can comply with
        the applicable privacy laws and the local data protection authorities’
        recommendations, should they prohibit the retention of any full IP
        addresses.<br />
        The anonymisation or masking of IP addresses takes place, as soon as
        they reach Google Analytics’ data collection network, but before the
        data would be saved or processed.

      <p>
        Like many other websites, we use the services of the newsletter company
        MailChimp on our website. The operator of MailChimp is the company The
        Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000,
        Atlanta, GA 30308 USA. With the aid of MailChimp we can easily send you
        interesting news via newsletter. For the use of the service we do not
        have to install anything but can still access a pool of very efficient
        features. In the following we will give more details on this email
        marketing service and will inform you about the most important data
        protection aspects.
      </p>
      <h3>What is MailChimp?</h3>
      <p>
        MailChimp is a cloud-based newsletter management service. “Cloud-based“
        means that we do not need to install MailChimp on our own computer or
        server. Instead, we use the service on an external server, or more
        specifically via an IT infrastructure, which is available via the
        internet. Using a software this way is also called SaaS (software as a
        service).
      </p>
      <p>
        MailChimp allows us to chose from a wide range of different email types.
        Depending on what goal we want to reach with our newsletter, we can run
        individual campaigns, regular campaigns, auto responders (automated
        emails), A/B tests, RSS campaigns (mailings at pre-set times and
        frequencies) and follow-up campaigns.
      </p>
      <h3>Why do we use MailChimp on our website?</h3>
      <p>
        The reason we would use any newsletter service is so we can stay in
        contact with you. We want to keep you on the loop what news or
        attractive offers we have for you at the time. As we constantly seek out
        the easiest and best solutions for our marketing measures, we have
        decided on MailChimp as our newsletter management service. While the
        software is very easy to use, it offers many helpful features. For
        example, it allows us to create interesting and attractive newsletters
        in only a short time. With integrated design templates we can create
        every newsletter in an individual way. Due to the “responsive design”
        feature, our contents are also presented in a readable and pleasant way
        on your smartphone (or any other mobile device).
      </p>
      <p>
        With tools such as A/B testing or the extensive analysis options, we can
        swiftly tell how you like our newsletters. This means that we can react
        if necessary and improve our offer or our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage is MailChimp’s “cloud system”. The data is not stored
        and processed directly on our server. We can retrieve the datafrom
        external servers and therefore save our memory space and also decrease
        maintenance effort.
      </p>
      <h3>What data is saved by MailChimp?</h3>
      <p>
        Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp) operate online platforms which
        enable us to get in contact with you, provided you subscribed to our
        newsletter. If you become a subscriber of our newsletter via our
        website, by email you agree to become a member of a MailChimp email
        list. Then, MailChimp saves your subscription data and your IP address,
        so it can verify your entry into the list provider. Moreover, MailChimp
        stores your email address, your name, your physical address and
        demographic information, such as language or location.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information is used to send emails to you and to allow certain
        other MailChimp functions (e.g. the evaluation of newsletters).
      </p>
      <p>
        MailChimp also shares information with third parties to improve its
        services. Moreover, MailChimp shares certain data with advertising
        partners of third parties to get a better understanding of its clients’
        interests, in order to provide relevant contents and target-oriented
        advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        With so-called “web beacons” (small graphics in HTML emails), MailChimp
        can determine if an email has arrived, has been opened or if links have
        been clicked. This information is then stored on MailChimp’s servers.
        That way we receive statistical evaluations and can see how you liked
        our newsletter. Therefore, we can tailor our offer better to your wishes
        and improve our service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, MailChimp are allowed to use this data for improving their own
        service. Thus, they can for example technically optimise the
        distribution or determine the location (or the country) of the
        recipient.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following cookies can be set by MailChimp. The list is not
        exhaustive and is merely an exemplary selection:

        For better display it could be that you would sometimes open our
        newsletter via a specified link. This can be the case if your email
        program does not work or if the newsletter is not displayed properly.
        The newsletter will then be shown via a MailChimp website. MailChimp
        also uses cookies on its websites (small text files which save data on
        your browser).<br />
        Personal data can be processed by MailChimp and their partners (e.g.
        Google Analytics). MailChimp is responsible for the collection of this
        data and we have no influence on it. MailChimp’s “Cookie Statement” (at:
        <a
          href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/</a
        >) tells you exactly how and why the company uses cookies.
      </p>
      <h3>How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
      <p>
        Since MailChimp is an American company, all retained data is stored on
        American servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, the data stays permanently saved on MailChimp’s servers and
        is deleted only when you request it. You can have your contact
        information with us deleted. This permanently removes all your personal
        data for us and anonymises you in MailChimp’s reports. However, you can
        also request the deletion of your data permanently at MailChimp. Then
        all your data are removed from there and we receive a notification from
        MailChimp. After we receive the email we have 30 days to delete your
        contact from all integrations.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
      <p>
        You can withdraw your approval for the receipt of our newsletters
        anytime, by clicking the link in the lower area of the received
        newsletter email. When you click on the unsubscribe link, your data with
        MailChimp gets deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you land on a MailChimp website via a link in our newsletter and
        cookies are consequently set in your browser, you can delete or
        deactivate these cookies anytime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the browser, the deactivation or deletion differs slightly.

        If you generally do not want to allow any cookies, you can set up your
        browser in a way so it would notify you whenever a potential cookie is
        about to be set. This lets you decide upon the placement of every single
        cookie.
